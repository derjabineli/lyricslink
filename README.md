# Lyricslink

Lyricslink is lyric sharing platform that integrates with Planning Center allowing users to create event containers with their selected songs. Once ready, the user can create a public link that can be shared giving their audience formatted lyrics.

Why am I building this? Leading worship at my local Church I often find myself needing to quickly share lyrics. Sending screenshots, asking people to search up lyrics etc. are all a headache and many others agree. Lyricslink will allow users to quickly share accurate and properly formatted lyrics for their congregations.
