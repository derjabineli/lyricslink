# Lyriclink

## Description

Lyricslink is lyric sharing platform that integrates with Planning Center allowing users to create event containers with their selected songs. Once ready, the user can create a public link that can be shared giving their audience formatted lyrics.

## Why?

There are obviously many ways to share lyrics. You can screenshot the lyrics and text them to your group. You could find a link with the correct lyircs and send that link. You could even create a doc and send that. But whatever your method is I'm sure you've realized that it's not efficient and is just simply not fun. That's why I built Lyriclink. Leading worship at my local Church I often find myself needing to quickly share lyrics. Sending screenshots, asking people to search up lyrics etc. are all a headache and take up time that I often don't have. Lyriclink allows users to quickly create sets and share accurate and properly formatted lyrics for their congregations. Better yet, you can even sync your Planning Center account and grab all of your Church's songs to use for your events. No more searcing for the right lyrics, getting the right formatting, making group chats. Everything simply lives on Lyriclink making this a better experience for you and your congregation.
